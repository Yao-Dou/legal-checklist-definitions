**What to look for:** If the court retains power to enforce the settlement

**Simple explanation:** 
- **Court-enforced (Yes):** The court keeps jurisdiction to make sure parties follow the settlement

2. **Evidence:** Physical evidence, documentary records, witness testimonies, etc., that support these facts
3. **Background information:** Context or explanatory facts that provide additional understanding

**Note:** The factual basis is crucial for determining the outcome of a case, as the judge or jury makes decisions based on the facts and the applicable legal principles.
